        "Fell into running by total accident when I joined the high school cross country team. What started as a way to hang out with friends quickly evolved into a genuine passion. These days, I'm all about road and trail running and pushing my endurance limits on longer distances. There's something meditative about hitting that rhythm on a good run that I can't find anywhere else.",

      description:
        "After college, I had a three-month gap before starting my first job. It was either backpack around Europe or learn to paraglideâ€”I chose the latter. Dove headfirst into the sport, bought my own wing, and flew almost every day for those three months, racking up 40 flying days as a complete beginner. Something about the combination of calculated risk, technical precision, and pure freedom just clicked. Now whenever I'm back in Colorado, the first thing I do is dig out my paraglider and hunt for thermals. Nothing beats the feeling of catching a perfect updraft and watching the world shrink beneath you.",

      description:
        "Started skiing at Stratton Mountain in Vermont, where the ice teaches you real edge control pretty quickly. East Coast skiing isn't glamorous, but it builds solid fundamentals. When I moved to Boulder for college, having the Rockies in my backyard was a game-changer. Suddenly I was hitting 30+ days a season, exploring new terrain, and chasing powder days. Skiing became my reward after long hours buried in my computer studying computer science in the stacks of Norlin Library. Now I try to get out whenever I go back to Colorado to visit Family.",
