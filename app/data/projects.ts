      challenge: "As I prepared for the New York City Marathon, I discovered that existing running apps lacked flexibility for customizing marathon training plans to fit individual schedules and preferences. Most apps offered rigid, pre-made plans with little room for personalization. Additionally, I wanted to challenge myself technically by integrating AI capabilities to create an intelligent training assistant that could generate personalized plans based on a runner's specific needs.",
      solution: "I built StrideSync as both a practical solution for my marathon training and a technical showcase. The application combines a flexible workout calendar with a Claude-powered AI coach that generates customized training plans as structured data. The system translates natural language conversations about fitness goals into actionable workout schedules, offering the personalization missing from commercial running apps while demonstrating advanced integration between modern web technologies and AI capabilities.",
